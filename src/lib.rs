# graphrs

`graphrs` is a Rust package for the creation, manipulation and analysis of [graphs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_(discrete_mathematics)).

It allows graphs to be created with support for:
* directed and undirected edges
* multiple edges between two nodes
* self-loops

## Major structs

* [Graph](./struct.Graph.html)
* [Node](./struct.Node.html)
* [Edge](./struct.Edge.html)

## Example: create a graph

```
use graphrs::{Edge, Graph, GraphSpecs, Node};

let nodes = vec![
    Node::from_name("n1"),
    Node::from_name("n2"),
    Node::from_name("n3"),
];

let edges = vec![
    Edge::with_weight("n1", "n2", 1.0),
    Edge::with_weight("n2", "n1", 2.0),
    Edge::with_weight("n1", "n3", 3.0),
    Edge::with_weight("n2", "n3", 3.0),
];

let specs = GraphSpecs::directed(); // change this to `::undirected()` to get an undirected graph

let graph = Graph::<&str, ()>::new_from_nodes_and_edges(
    nodes,
    edges,
    specs
);
```

## Example: create a graph from just edges

```
use graphrs::{Edge, Graph, GraphSpecs, Node};

let mut graph = Graph::<&str, ()>::new(GraphSpecs::directed_create_missing());
graph.add_edges(vec![
    Edge::with_weight("n1", "n2", 1.0),
    Edge::with_weight("n2", "n1", 2.0),
    Edge::with_weight("n1", "n3", 3.0),
    Edge::with_weight("n2", "n3", 3.0),
]);
```

## Example: create a graph with nodes that have attributes

```
use graphrs::{Edge, Graph, GraphSpecs, Node};

#[derive(Copy, Clone)]
struct NodeAttribute<'a> {
    first_name: &'a str,
    last_name: &'a str,
};

let mut graph: Graph<i32, NodeAttribute> = Graph::new(GraphSpecs::undirected());
let node = Node::from_name_and_attributes(1, NodeAttribute {first_name: "John", last_name: "Doe"});
graph.add_node(node);
```
